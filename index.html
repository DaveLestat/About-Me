        <p>As a person who was brought up doing heavy construction work as a kid, I grew up with an affinity towards doing things the simler way.  Not to be confused with doing things the cheap way, I really take pride in my work.</p>

        <p>After serving in the Navy for six years, I really came to appreciate efficiency.  Nameyly, because the Navy didn't seem to have any.  I remember an old Chief whose mantra was "Work smatha, no hardda"</p>

        <p>Truth is . . . . . I am lazy.  I like to wake up, drink my milk and donuts and know that the complex project I have ahead will be much  simpler because of the tools I poses.  I am still driven, and take an awful lot of pride in my work.  I merely don't like working too much for too little return.  I have learned that if you are smart and efficient, you can accomplish the same level of output with less input.  And I sure like my milk and donuts.</p>

        <p>As a software developer, I believe I can help people achieve the same goal I have: "Efficiency through simplicity".  If I can make a software or an app that does half of your work, I have already accomplished my goal.  And that is why I am in CodeFellows.</p>

        <p>Well, that, and the money.  I like my milk and donuts after all.</p>
